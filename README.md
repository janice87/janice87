### Hi, I'm Janice ðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring Software Engineer/Full Stack Developer from New York. I work full time and am a student at Flatiron School. My background is in Finance/Accounting and I am a problem solver who is highly detail oriented and analytical. Over the past 9 years I've worked in industries ranging from healthcare, publishing, media and retail. I love learning new things and being able to express myself creatively by making or building things. My hobbies are yoga, photography, gardening and playing the Sims (if I have free time).


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently on Phase 4 at the Flatiron School
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rails
- âœ¨ Fun fact: I used to work for Disney and I've been to Hawaii 4 times. My dream would be to live there one day.
