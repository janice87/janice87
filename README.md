### Hi, I'm Janice ðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring Software Engineer from New York. I am a mom working full time and a student at the Flatiron School. I have a background in Finance/Accounting and am highly detail oriented, analytical and organized. Over the past 9 years I've worked in industries ranging from healthcare, publishing, media and retail. I love to make and build things, which is why becoming a Full Stack Developer/Software Engineer is my dream job. My hobbies are yoga, photography, gardening and playing the Sims (if I have free time).


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently on Phase 4 at the Flatiron School
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rails
- âœ¨ Fun fact: I used to work for Disney and I've been to Hawaii 4 times. My dream would be to live there one day.
